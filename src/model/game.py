Represents a game happening on the server. Updates for the game state are sent
from the server, identified by game uid. Updates are propagated with signals.

The game with a given uid starts when we receive the first game message and
ends with some update, or is ended manually. Once the game ends, it can't be
updated or ended again. Update and game end are propagated with signals.

If an update is malformed / forbidden, an exception is thrown.
