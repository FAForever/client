"""
Keeps track of currently active games. Passes game state messages to correct
games or creates them if there's no game with a given uid. Removes games that
closed. Reports creation and state change of games. Gives access to active games.

Note that it doesn't remember which games ended - the server may choose to
send a game state for a uid, send a state that closes it, then send a state
with the same uid again, and it will be reported as a new game.
